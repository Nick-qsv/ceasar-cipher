A simple implementation of the Ceasar Cipher in Rust. This program allows the user to input a password and a message, which it will then encrypt using the Ceasar Cipher method. The encrypted message can only be decrypted using the same password that was used to encrypt it.

In order to run the program, you will need to have the latest version of Rust installed on your computer.

## Running the Program
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the program is located.
3. Type cargo run and press enter to run the program.
4. Follow the prompts to input your password and message. The program will then encrypt your message using the Ceasar Cipher method.
